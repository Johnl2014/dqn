    """Class implementing DQN.

    This is a basic outline of the functions/parameters you will need
    in order to implement the DQNAgnet. This is just to get you
    started. You may need to tweak the parameters, add new ones, etc.

    Feel free to change the functions and function parameters that the
    class provides.

    We have provided docstrings to go along with our suggested API.

    Parameters
    ----------
    q_network: keras.models.Model
      Your Q-network model.
    preprocessor: deeprl_hw2.core.Preprocessor
      The preprocessor class. See the associated classes for more
      details.
    memory: deeprl_hw2.core.Memory
      Your replay memory.
    gamma: float
      Discount factor.
    target_update_freq: float
      Frequency to update the target network. You can either provide a
      number representing a soft target update (see utils.py) or a
      hard target update (see utils.py and Atari paper.)
    num_burn_in: int
      Before you begin updating the Q-network your replay memory has
      to be filled up with some number of samples. This number says
      how many.
    train_freq: int
      How often you actually update your Q-Network. Sometimes
      stability is improved if you collect a couple samples for your
      replay memory, for every Q-network update that you run.
    batch_size: int
      How many samples in each minibatch.
    double: boolean
      double model or single model
